# The Monkee's Website

The reason for making this website was for the very first milestone project on my course. It's a front end website only to showcase what I've learned so far in the first 3 modules where I learned about HTML, CSS, and responsive design. We were given pictures, audio clips, and videos to use throughout the website.
 
## UX
 
On my website I have 4 main web pages home, the band, media, and contact. My aim was to give fans and potential fans the chance to gather more information about each of the band members, Listen and watch the monkees clips/videos, look at picture of them past and present, and also contact them via the contact page where there's 2 contact forms for business & for fans.

##### User Stories
* Fan/potential Fan - I would like a way for me to look what music that's newly released or upcoming
* Fan/potential Fan - I would Like to listen to their music, watch videos, and look at pictures
* Fan - A way for me to send fan mail and send them art
* employer - A way to get in contact with them for business
* employer - Browse their songs in their library

Again, users will be able to look at a gallery of the monkees to see what they look like performing and also what they look like now compared to what they used to look like in their prime.

##### Forms
The contact forms are there for 2 sperate reasons. The first Is aimed at business reasons only where people can get in contact with the monkees on a general business level or if they want to hire them for parties or weddings.
