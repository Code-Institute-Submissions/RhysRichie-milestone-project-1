# The Monkee's Website

The reason for making this website was for the very first milestone project on my course. It's a front end website only to showcase what I've learned so far in the first 3 modules where I learned about HTML, CSS, and responsive design. We were given pictures, audio clips, and videos to use throughout the website.
 
## UX
 
On my website I have 4 main web pages home, the band, media, and contact. My aim was to give fans and potential fans the chance to gather more information about each of the band members, Listen and watch the monkees clips/videos, look at picture of them past and present, and also contact them via the contact page where there's 2 contact forms for business & for fans.

##### User Stories
* Fan/potential Fan - I would like a way for me to look what music that's newly released or upcoming
* Fan/potential Fan - I would Like to listen to their music, watch videos, and look at pictures
* Fan - A way for me to send fan mail and send them art
* employer - A way to get in contact with them for business
* employer - Browse their songs in their library

## Features

##### Navigation

This Allows users of any kind to visit the page and explore around the different webpages without having to go back to previous pages just to get to a different area in the website.

##### New and Upcoming releases
New and Potential Fans are able to see what's the newest album out, what songs are on there, and if it's not out yet they will be able to see a release date. 

##### About Sections
Fans and potential fans can read up on the different band members to see what they got up to before starting in a band with the monkees together and all other form of information.

##### Videos
Anyone is able to watch the videos and see them in action when performing/in music videos.

##### Music Clips
Users get to listen to their music and get to see if they like it or not, future employees get to also listen to their music to see if they want to follow through with contacting them on any matter.

##### Pictures
Again, users will be able to look at a gallery of the monkees to see what they look like performing and also what they look like now compared to what they used to look like in their prime.

##### Forms
The contact forms are there for 2 sperate reasons. The first Is aimed at business reasons only where people can get in contact with the monkees on a general business level or if they want to hire them for parties or weddings.
##### Footer
In the footer there's 3 social media links where they divert the user to their social media pages where the user is able to see what the monkees are doing on a more personal level.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
